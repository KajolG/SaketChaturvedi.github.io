# Skin Lesion Analyser (http://skinlesionanalyser.tk/)

Skin cancer is a major public health problem with over 123,000 newly diagnosed cases worldwide in each year. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, globally accounting for at least 40% of cases.

The project was aimed to develop a web application for skin lesion analysis. This web application predicts the skin lesion among 7 classes based on HAM1000 dataset. The MobileNet model was trained on HAM10000 dataset to build reliable web application interface. This web application has a potential to make predictions within 2 seconds with categorical accuracy 83.15%, top2 accuracy 91.36% and top3 accuracy 95.34%. The TensorFlow.js library was used to convert and train MobileNet model in JavaScript. The web application interface was developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Lastly, the project was deployed as a web application on GitHub server.
